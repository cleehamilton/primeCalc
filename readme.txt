Purpose:
    Prime Calculator is a program written in python to calculate prime numbers. 
    
    1. It continues to loop numbers based on the length of the number being tested. (i.e The lengths of prime number 337 and prime number 787 are both 3. The length of prime number 2927 is 4.)
        A. the loop will continue until a number to test is reached that has a length equal to the number set in this variable, then it stops.
        B. the loop will not test through the length set in the variable, it stops at that length.
    2. The three tests are based upon the algorithm found at this page https://byjus.com/maths/how-to-find-prime-numbers/. 
    2. It will output in the terminal if the number is a prime or not a prime
    3. It will log the prime numbers in a text file as a new line item.
    4. Verbose mode:
        A. Set to 0 will output if the number is prime or not.
        B. Set to 1 will output each step as it is performed.
